I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Glasgow supervised by Jeff Dalton.

I was part of the winning team that won the 2021-2022 Amazon Alexa Prize TaskBot Challenge.

My work focuses on using multi-modal information to improve on Music Information Retrieval tasks, trying to inject world knowledge into them. I explore how Music systems can learn about world knowledge, exploiting multi-modal information to improve their capabilities to solve music tasks. 

I apply my research to Music Information Retrieval tasks, using contrastive learning to try to teach them information.
