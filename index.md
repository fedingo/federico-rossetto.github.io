I'm a **Ph.D. student** at the University of Glasgow supervised by [Jeff Dalton](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jeff/){:target="_blank"}

I was part of the winning team that won the [2021-2022 Amazon Alexa Prize TaskBot Challenge](https://www.amazon.science/alexa-prize/taskbot-challenge/2021){:target="_blank"}.

My work focuses on using **Multi-Modal** information to improve on **Music Information Retrieval** tasks, trying to inject world knowledge into them. I explore how Music systems can learn about world knowledge, exploiting Multi-Modal content to improve their capabilities to solve music tasks. 

I apply my research to Music Information Retrieval tasks, using contrastive learning to try to teach them multi-modal world knowledge.
